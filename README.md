# Carousel-Implementation

In this project, I tried to implement a program which can be used to construct a banner area in a webpage.
This includes content, style and functions stored in HTML, CSS and JS files respectively. 
It is a basic trick for front-end developer and it can be implemented without any library but original js methods.
